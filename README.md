# Sweeper
An infinite arena survival game where you use a broom to whack spiders and cobwebs. Made in Godot 3.5.

## Installation
You can get a .zip file for your platform on the [releases](https://github.com/lilyyllyyllyly/Sweeper/releases) section or the [itch.io page](https://lilyyllyyllyly.itch.io/sweeper).

Alternatively, you can clone this repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/lilyyllyyllyly/Sweeper.git`

And open it with [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x) (make sure to use the mono version, as this project is made using C#) to export your own build.

## Execution
After extracting the .zip file (see [Installation](installation)), you can run the game with the Sweeper_1-5-0 (.x86_64, .exe or .html) file inside the Linux, Windows or HTML5 folder depending on your platform.

You can also play the game directly in your browser in the [itch.io page](https://lilyyllyyllyly.itch.io/sweeper).

## How to play
Controls:
- Use the WASD keys to move
- Move the cursor to aim
- Hold the left mouse button to charge
- Release the left mouse button to attack

Your goal is to survive as long as possible while killing spiders and destroying cobwebs to increase your score.

You can attack the spiders with your broom to knock them into walls, killing them. They are knocked back futher if you charge longer.

The spiders will constantly appear from the cobwebs, so make sure to destroy them before it gets out of control! (it also gives you a lot of score!)
